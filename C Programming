/***What is C?***
* - A procedural language with all its code insidde a function which acts as a source code for a program.
* - It has to be compliled with a compiler, in my case, gcc to create an executable file

/***Variables***
* Data types: signed(without typing signed) and unsigned: char (1byte|255), short (2bytes|65,535), int (4bytes|4,294,967,295), long (8bytes|18,446,744,073,709,551,615)
* Declaration: 
    - syntax: type var_name;
    - example: int i;
    Names of variables: [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]* i.e cannot start with numbers, and cannot contain specal characters and whitespaces
* Arrays: Multiple items of same type assigned to a variable
  Declaration:
    - syntax: type var_name [no_of_items]
    - example: int my_array_of_arrays [6][9];
* Structures: Improvised data type declaration for a group of variables to be placed under one name in memory
    - syntax: sruct structure_name {
                type name;
                type name;
                type name;
              };
              struct structure_name var_name;
      This is very similar to objects i.e having different variable types under the same umbrella
    -  example: struct car_properties {
                    char name;
                    int price;
                    int no_tyres;
                    char paint;
                };
                struct car_properties my_car;
    - The above examples are for creation and declaration
* Arrays and Structures
    - Arrays of structures: struct new_struct var_array[14];
    - Structre with structure: struct student {
                                    char first_name[5];
                                    char lst_name[5];
                                    struct address addr;
                               }
